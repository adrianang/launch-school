/**
 * 01. Write a program named greeter.js that greets 'Victor' three times. Your
 *     program should use a variable and not hard code the string value 'Victor'
 *     in each greeting. Here's an example run of the program:
 * 
 *     $ node greeter.js
 *     Good Morning, Victor.
 *     Good Afternoon, Victor.
 *     Good Evening, Victor.

console.log(`Good Morning, ${nameToGreet}.`);
console.log(`Good Afternoon, ${nameToGreet}.`);
console.log(`Good Evening, ${nameToGreet}.`);
