/**
 * 05. What does the following function do?
 * 
 *     function doSomething(string) {
 *       return string.split(' ').reverse().map((value) => value.length);
 *     }
 */

/**
 * This function takes a string, separates it at each space character and
 * places the words in an array, reverses the words in that array, and replaces
 * each word/element with its length.
 * 
 * The final outcome would be an array of the lengths of the original words in
 * a string, in reverse order (from the string).
