/**
 * 05. What does the following code log to the console?
 *    
 *     function scream(words) {
 *       return words + '!!!!';
 *     }
 *     
 *     scream('Yipeee');
 */

/**
 * The following code also does not log anything to the console. The scream()
 * function does not have a console.log statement anywhere, nor is the call to
 * scream('Yipeee') passed into a call to console.log.
 * 
 * Although it does not log anything, it does return 'Yipeee!!!!' since
 * scream() returns whatever string argument is passed in concatenated with
 * four exclamation points.
