/**
 * 12. What value does the following expression evaluate to?
 *     > '12' < '9'
 */

/**
 * This expression evaluates to true. This is because the < operator is
 * comparing the UTF-16 code for the first character of each string. The UTF-16
 * code for '1' (49) is less than the UTF-16 code for '9' (57), thus evaluating
 * this expression to true.
